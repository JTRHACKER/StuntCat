It's an awesome 2D Souls-like Platformer that can give you a lot of wonderful impressions!

By the way, I used word-play in the title: "StuntCat".

My game has really hard gameplay(its so-called mode: "Yes, honey, hurt me plenty!") and can you collect although 100 scores?

If you don't afraid let's play!

I'm opening for you the whole new world with such adventures and events that you can't imagine yourself!

First, I did it for learning new things(in particular, dive into work with computer graphics on a completely new level of quality).

Second, I want to be able to prove that Python(of course, not without PyGame's help) is a pretty language for serious game development.

I'm so proud of myself because I could finish this hard project successfully.

During the creation, I really put my soul into this project.

I really hope that you increase my GitHub rating if you enjoy the game.
